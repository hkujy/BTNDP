# NSGA
## non-dominated sorting
1. Create variables and index
   1. dominated count 
   2. set of domininated solutions 
   3. a index indicate which level the solution belongs
   4. array store the number of solutions in each level (I think i can specify a maximum numeber)
   5. write a fortran general queue operaiton?? (too complicated)
2. Create a function 
   1. input: two solutions 
   2. output: the dominated relatiosn ship of the solution 
3. Function to update the fronteria of the solutions
